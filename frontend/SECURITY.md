## Security Architecture

### What this tool does

`free-coding-models` is a CLI tool that:

1. Pings AI model API endpoints to measure latency
2. Writes model configuration to supported coding tool config files
3. Stores API keys locally in the user's home directory

### What this tool does NOT do

- ❌ Does **not** collect, transmit, or store source code
- ❌ Does **not** send prompts or completions to any server we operate
- ❌ Does **not** execute arbitrary code from remote servers
- ❌ Does **not** require root/admin privileges
- ❌ Does **not** access files outside of:
  - `~/.config/opencode/` (OpenCode config)
  - `~/.openclaw/` (OpenClaw config)
  - `~/.crush/` (Crush config)
  - `~/.config/goose/` (Goose config)
  - `~/.aider.conf.yml` (Aider config)
  - `~/.config/openhands/` (OpenHands config)
  - `~/.config/amp/` (Amp config)
  - `~/.pi/` (Pi config)
  - Tool-specific config directories (only when explicitly requested)

### API keys

- API keys are stored **locally only** in `~/.free-coding-models-keys.json`
- Keys are **never** sent to any server except the matching provider API endpoint
- Keys are **never** logged, printed in plaintext, or included in telemetry
- Config file has restrictive permissions (user-only readable)

### Network activity

The tool makes HTTPS requests **only** to:

| Purpose | Endpoints |
| ------- | --------- |
| Model APIs | Provider API endpoints (listed in sources.js) |
| npm registry | `registry.npmjs.org` (version check only) |
| Telemetry | Anonymous usage stats (no personal info, no keys, no code) |

No other outbound network connections are made.

### Dependencies

This project has **1 runtime dependency**: `chalk` (terminal colors).

Minimal dependency surface = minimal attack surface.
